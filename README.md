- [Nanopublications in HTML](https://raw.githack.com/peta-pico/debate-nanopubs/master/example1/trusty.debate.trig.html)
- [Nanopublication sources](example1/)

Links:

- [IBIS on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-based_information_system)
- [IBIS RDF](https://web.archive.org/web/20100525235757/http://hyperdata.org/xmlns/ibis/) (seems very much defunct)
